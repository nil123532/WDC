# WDC Project

- Please install necessary libraries for the project: nodemailer, Oauth, 
- For Google Sign-Ins, since we do not have an actual domain registered, if you try to use the Google Login in a non-verified origin path (domain), it will not let you and come up as restricted. This is due to the recent change in Google which took place on May 30th. Please contact us for this so that we can authorize your doamin (for cs50) so the login works.
- The google login is very buggy so to use it correctly, clear your cache and it should work properly afterwards.
